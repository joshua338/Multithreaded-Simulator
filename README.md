# Real-Time Multi-threaded Application Simulator

This project simulates how operating systems handle multithreading, thread states, synchronization, and CPU scheduling using:

## ✔ Threading Models
- **Many-to-One**
- **One-to-One**
- **Many-to-Many (Thread Pool)**

## ✔ Synchronization Techniques
- **Monitor (Lock)**
- **Semaphore (Binary Semaphore)**

## ✔ Thread States Visualized
- NEW  
- READY  
- RUNNING  
- BLOCKED  
- TERMINATED  

The simulator prints every state change in real-time.
